<section id="question">
<h2>How do I manage date formats on a web page?</h2>
<p>Visitors to a web site from varying locales may be confused by date formats. The format MM/DD/YY is unique to the United States (but sometimes used in Canada, too, which can obviously create some confusion there). Most of Europe uses DD/MM/YY. Japan uses YY/MM/DD. The separators may be slashes, dashes or periods. Some locales print leading zeroes, others suppress them. If a native Japanese speaker is reading a US English web page from a web site in Germany that contains the date 03/04/02 how do they interpret it?</p>
<p>Your first impulse may be to assume this problem will be taken care of during localization of the web pages - i.e. let the translator fix it. Resist this impulse. Do you really want to keep separate copies of documents for the U.S. and the U.K. that differ only in date format? In any case you still have to deal with multilingual users like the one in our example above.</p>

    There are mainly two types of problems related to date processing on the Web: <a href="#input">how the user enters a date</a> and <a href="#display">how the author displays a date</a>.
  </p>

	<section>
    <h2 id="input">The <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element</h2>

    <p>
      When it comes to accpet data from the user, the first thing we think of is the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> HTML element.
      HTML5 introduced <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements of type <code>date</code>, <code>time</code>, <code>datetime-local</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>week</code>, which let the user easily enter a date or a time, like:
    </p>

    <p>
    <label for="date">&lt;input type="<strong>date</strong>"&gt;</label>
      <input type="date" id="date" name="date"
       value="2021-12-07"
       min="2021-12-05" max="2021-12-10">
    </p>
      <p>
       <label for="time">&lt;input type="<strong>time</strong>"&gt;</label>
      <input type="time" id="time" name="time"
       min="09:00" max="18:00" required>
      </p>
      <p>
       <label for="datetime-local">&lt;input type="<strong>datetime-local</strong>"&gt;</label>
      <input type="datetime-local" id="datetime-local"
       name="datetime-local" value="2021-12-07T18:00"
       min="2021-12-05T00:00" max="2021-12-10T00:00">
      </p>
      <p>
       <label for="month">&lt;input type="<strong>month</strong>"&gt;</label>
      <input type="month" id="month"
       name="month" value="2021-01"
       min="2021-01">
      </p>
      <p>
       <label for="week">&lt;input type="<strong>week</strong>"&gt;</label>
      <input type="week" id="week"
       name="week" min="2021-W01"
       min="2021-W05">
      </p>

    <p>
      Each browser has its own way of rendering these elements, and browsers that do not support them will fall back to a single-line text field.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#dates-and-times">HTML</a> uses a variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> standard for its date and time strings. The date and time strings do not include the time zone data. The time zone data can be stored on the server-side separately if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can set a default value for the input by using the <code>value</code> attribute or restrict the date or time using the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> attributes.
    </p>

<section>
  <h2 id="display"><a href="#display">Store and display a date</a></h2>

  <p>You have four options to consider, all with advantages and drawbacks:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Use a locale neutral format</li>
    <li>Make the month and year obvious</li>
    <li>Use the Accept-Language HTTP header</li>
    <li>Use JavaScript</li>
  </ol>

	<section id="opt1">
<h3>Option One: Use a locale neutral format</h3>
    <p>ISO 8601 specifies a format of YYYY-MM-DD. 2003-04-02 is clearer than 03/04/02. (Some prefer to modify ISO 8601 by using an
      abbreviation for the month to make it more clear, for example 2003-Apr-02, but then it is no longer locale neutral.). </p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>This method is unambiguous.</li>
      <li>ISO 8601 is computer friendly. Doing a standard character sort on a list of dates gives you a chronologically ordered list.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>ISO 8601 is people unfriendly. People are comfortable with their "natural" date formats.</li>
      <li>It takes more space. For a date in a paragraph of text this is no big deal. If a document is a table with some columns containing
        dates the extra space might become an issue, especially if you've designed a layout that is already pressed for space.</li>
      <li>This may be particularly user unfriendly in countries where an alternative calendar is used (eg. Thailand favours the Buddhist
        calendar).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

	<section id="opt2">
<h3>Option Two: Make the month and year obvious</h3>
    <p>To do this use a name for the month (abbreviated or not) and use 4 digits for all Gregorian year numbers. For example, 2 April
      2003.</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>This method is completely unambiguous.</li>
      <li>It is people friendly. People are comfortable with their "natural" date formats.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is less computer friendly when it comes to sorting, etc.</li>
      <li>It takes more space. In some locales even the abbreviation for a month name may be longer than three characters. (In French the
        first three letters of <em>June</em> and <em>July</em> are the same, <em><span lang="fr">juin</span></em> and <em><span lang="fr">juillet</span></em>). Allowing extra space for this exacerbates the space problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

	<section id="opt3">
<h3>Option Three: Use the Accept-Language HTTP header</h3>
    <p>The HTTP Accept-Language header only specifies the user's language preferences, but is commonly used to determine locale preferences
      as well.</p>
    <p>This method works well for dynamically generated web documents when inserting a date from some back-end storage into a page, as long
      as the user's expectations of date format are clear. Appropriateness is a function of the linguistic context rather than simply the user's browser
      settings. <span id="japanese-eg">For example</span>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Inserting a date from a database into a <em>Japanese</em> page with a Japanese format would be very helpful for the user.</li>
      <li>A Japanese person reading the generated date 03/04/02 in an <em>English</em> document might mistakenly assume that this used an
        English ordering.</li>
      <li>Displaying a generated date in a Japanese date format such as <span lang="ja">２００３年４月２日</span> in an English page
        would probably look out of place.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How this is done will vary depending on your development environment.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="opt4"><a href="#opt4">Option Four: Use JavaScript</a></h3>
    <p>
      The JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a> object represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format. It is specified as the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several methods in <code>Date</code> to return a string representation of a particular current date and time in various formats and perform time zone conversions. For example, the <code>toLocaleString</code> method returns a string with a language sensitive representation of this date.
    </p>
  </section>
	<section id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>No ideal solution exists for this problem. Weigh the options and choose according to your preferences and your situation.</p>
    <p>If there is likely to be any ambiguity on the part of the user, it is usually best to use explicit month names and 4-digit years for
      Gregorian dates, or at least indicate on the page how to read the dates.</p>
    <p>Dates can be reformatted using dynamic techniques to match the linguistic context of the page.</p>
  </section>
</section>


<section id="bytheway">
<h2>By the way</h2>
  <p>Some have advocated the creation of a <code class="kw" translate="no">date</code> tag that would display dates according the locale of the user agent. This is subject to the same practical issues as described for dynamic date generation with the <a href="#japanese-eg">Japanese example</a>. The appropriate format is generally a function of the linguistic context of a page, rather than the user's platform.</p>
